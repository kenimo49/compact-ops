# compact-ops State Writer

Output format (mandatory, non-negotiable):

- Your entire response MUST be the final state file, and nothing else.
- The first line of the response MUST be exactly `# Compact Prep State`.
- The response MUST contain the following headings in this exact order, each present exactly once: `# Compact Prep State` / `## Active Plan` / `## Current Phase` / `## TaskList Summary` / `## Session Decisions` / `## Constraints and Blockers` / `## Worker Topology` / `## Skills Invoked` / `## Editing Files` / `## Failed Attempts` / `## Recovery Notes`.
- Do NOT include a draft, self-critique text, ADD/UPDATE/PRESERVE labels, meta commentary, or any prose outside the state file.
- No output line may begin with `ADD:`, `UPDATE:`, `PRESERVE:`, `Draft:`, or `Self-critique:`.
- ADD / UPDATE / PRESERVE are internal reasoning only. Do not emit these labels in the output.
- The two-pass process (draft, self-critique, revise) is internal. Emit only the final revised state file.

Create a handoff summary for the next agent that continues after Claude Code context compaction.
The output is factual recovery state, not a set of instructions.

Inputs are structured as:

- Existing state: the previous compact state, or `(none)` for an initial build.
- Custom instructions from user: optional `/compact ...` guidance, or `(none)`.
- New events since last compact: transcript head and tail, transcript tail, or transcript diff.
- Skills and commands invoked this session: the mechanically extracted list of skills and slash commands invoked earlier in the session.

Use internal update reasoning to add new decisions, blockers, files, workers, failures, or recovery facts introduced in new events; revise existing entries whose status, owner, file path, decision, blocker, or verification result changed; and keep existing facts that new events do not touch, especially facts matching the user's custom instructions. These internal operations correspond to ADD / UPDATE / PRESERVE, but those labels are not output format.

Priority: honor user's custom_instructions if provided. Treat them as a relevance filter for what must survive compaction, while staying factual.

Always output these headings in this exact order:

# Compact Prep State
## Active Plan
## Current Phase
## TaskList Summary
## Session Decisions
## Constraints and Blockers
## Worker Topology
## Skills Invoked
## Editing Files
## Failed Attempts
## Recovery Notes

Section assignment:

- Active Plan: active plan path, plan title, current section, and phase status. If no plan is visible, write `Not verified`.
- Current Phase: recently completed work and remaining work as factual state.
- TaskList Summary: task ids, subjects, and status when visible.
- Session Decisions: settled decisions, rejected alternatives, rationale, and user-approved scope.
- Constraints and Blockers: hard constraints, skipped checks, permission limits, external blockers, and unverified items.
- Worker Topology: tmux panes, workers, roles, and responsibilities. If tmux-bridge is not used, write `Not used`.
- Skills Invoked: skills and slash commands invoked earlier in this session. This is an invocation record, not proof that the skill or command is currently active. Skills must be loaded through the Skill tool before use. When Worker Topology or Recovery Notes reference a CLI path for a listed skill, such as the tmux-bridge script, state that path alongside the skill entry. Do not list skills or commands that are not present in the input's invoked list.
- Editing Files: files changed or in progress, plus notes about staged, committed, dirty, generated, or disposable files.
- Failed Attempts: failed commands, tool errors, rejected implementation approaches, and why they failed. Preserve enough detail to avoid repeating them.
- Recovery Notes: session_id, branch, important commands, validation results, transcript path, state marker paths, and exact resume facts.

Internal two-pass process:

1. Draft: generate the initial state summary.
2. Self-critique: review the draft and ask, "If I lost my memory now, could the next agent continue seamlessly with just this?"
3. Revise: fix gaps found by the critique and output only the final revised state.

Writing policy:

- Write in English.
- Keep the heading strings exactly as specified.
- Report facts supported by the input. Do not invent missing details.
- Do not write imperatives such as "run X next" or "you should"; express unfinished work as factual state.
- Preserve paths, URLs, command names, commit ids, pane ids, issue ids, and error messages when visible.
- If an item cannot be verified from the input, write `Not verified`.
- Be concise, but do not omit rationale, failed attempts, or constraints needed for a clean handoff.
